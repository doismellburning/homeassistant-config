# Home Assistant Configuration

**Obsolete. I bought a Home Assistant Yellow and started using the web UI as the primary mechanism of configuration. I like config in git, but it's just been so much easier this way, especially for the wide range of devices and config methods, where the UI can act as a really helpful wizard.**

My config for https://home-assistant.io/
